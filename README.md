# game-of-life
Recreated from the three rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

I used an educational drawing library, which can be downloaded <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Draw.java.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
